# Artemis_Financial_Vulnerability_Assessment_Report

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial services company that I created a Vulnerability assessment for. The vulnerability assessment identified concerns that may impact their ability to keep their client's information safe by complying with industry standards.


What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I successfully found security vulnerabilities by using an OWASP Dependency Check. Secure coding is important when working with sensitive client data. A leak or breach can cost customers their valuable information and can have a damaging impact on the company and the way it is perceived. Maintaining compliance helps the company's well-being because they will be following strict security guidelines to ensure their customer's safety.


Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The hardest part of the vulnerability assessment was taking an in-depth review of the code to understand its goals and the requirements it has in order to function successfully. The Dependency check is helpful because of its automatic in-depth analysis and it's provided explanations.


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

HTTPS was implemented to ensure secure communication. Static security tests were also utilized. In the future, using automation in combination with manual assessments will ensure that the code is reliable.


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I tested the code repeatedly during refactoring while also maintaining compliance with established standards. Static testing was then performed after refactoring and a vulnerability check.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

OWASP Dependency Check Maven will definitely be incorporated into future assignments because it is so thorough and easy to implement.


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

This assignment displays my ability to mitigate vulnerability in a realistic environment. Testing code and checking for vulnerabilities is absolutely crucial in code development. I believe this project shows that I am able to produce safe and reliable code for a company.
